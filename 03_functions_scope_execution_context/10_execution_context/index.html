    <h1>Execution Context</h1>
    <p>When you run any JavaScript, a special environment is created to handle the transformation & execution of code.
        This is called the <b>execution context</b>. It contains the currently running code and everything that aids in
        its execution.</p>
    <hr>
    <p>There is a global execution context as well as a function execution context for every function invoked.</p>

    <h1>Execution Context Phases</h1>
    <h3>Memory Creation Phase</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Create the global object (browser = window, Node.js = global)</li>
        <li>Create the 'this' object and bind it to the global object</li>
        <li>Setup memory heap for storing variables and function references</li>
        <li>Store functions and variables in global execution context and set to "undefined"</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Execution Phase</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Execute code line by line</li>
        <li>Create a new execution context for each function call</li>
    </ol>
