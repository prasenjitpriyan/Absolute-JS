# FizzBuzz Challenge

Instructions:

* Print/log the number from 1 to 100;
* For **multiple of three** print 'Fizz' instead of the number;
* For **multiple of five** print 'Buzz';
* For numbers which are **multiple of both three and five** print 'FizzBuzz';

Hints:

> If you have taken the course up to this point, then you know how to write a loop and output/log something for each iteration. You also know how to check for a condition with "is/else/else if". You also know how to get a remainder of a number using the modulus operator(%). This is all you need to know to complete this challenge. Good luck!
